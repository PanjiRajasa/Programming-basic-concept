1. Variable = The container to contain a data
- normal variable = the data inside it can be changed 
- final variable = the data inside it can't be changed
2. Conditional statements = these are expressions that determine if a variable is true or false
- scheme : if A > 80:
              true // the true expressions would be appear if the "if" condition is corresponding with the present condition
            else:
              false // would be happen if the "if" condition isn't corresponding with present the condition
- these conditional statements comes in four parts:
  •if
  •if else
  •if else if
  •ladder
3. Looping and iterations = iterations is any time a program repeat a proccess or sequence
                            • loops are a common type of iterations
loops comes with 3 condition:
  •"for" loop
  •"while" loop
  •"do while" loop
4. Data types = help classify what information a variable can hold and what can be done with it
  • The most common data types :
    * int = integer number exp. 8,9,0,1
    * decimal = decimal number, in some of programming language it is called a floating number exp. 2.99, 3.77
    * booleans = a data that can hold only 2 values which are true and false
    * characters = values,all data that only contains 1 character exp. a,b,c,f,w,x,z
    * strings = anythings between 2 double quotes ("") or 2 single quotes ('')
