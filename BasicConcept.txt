1. Variable = The container to contain a data
- normal variable = the data inside it can be changed 
- final variable = the data inside it can't be changed
2. Conditional statements = these are expressions that determine if a variable is true or false
- scheme : if A > 80:
              true // the true expressions would be appear if the "if" condition is corresponding with the present condition
            else:
              false // would be happen if the "if" condition isn't corresponding with present the condition
- these conditional statements comes in four parts:
  •if
  •if else
  •if else if
  •ladder
3. Looping and iterations = iterations is any time a program repeat a proccess or sequence
                            • loops are a common type of iterations
